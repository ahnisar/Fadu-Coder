*What are you planning to build?
	:We are making "QUAKE DETECTING SENSORS" to detect early earthquakes.
	 The sensors used will be picking frequencies of vibration produced by nearby surrounding objects.
   
*How does it works?
	:It is based on principle that the sensors would keep record of the natural frequency of vibration of all surrounding objects.
         Upon showing noticable changes from their respective frequency ranges, it will alarm security management.
	 We will be employing numerous different variaties of sensors in different earthquake prone areas.
	 Accordingly we will be receiving inputs of the given signals and will be activating our alarm security system.
	 And we will be preparing precautionary measures for the people of respective areas.
   
*How user can get started with the project?
	:Information of range of natural frequencies of the surrounding objects can be given to the sensors & the sensors
	 will alarm user on detecting noticeable deviation.
   
*What datasets are we using?
	:We are using the data of naturel frequencies of different materials present in the surroudings of the sensors.
	 Using the data sets the  sensory predict the deviation and give alarm. 
	 This data sets are obtained from various test experiments done before the application of apparatus and implement of project.
   
*What technologies are we using?
	:Optical Fibre Sensors,
	 Intensity based vibration sensors
	 Non-contact displacement intensity based sensors
	 Microbends sensors structures.
